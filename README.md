cd portfolio-website
```

2. Install dependencies:

# or

## Customization

### Content Configuration

The portfolio content is managed through a JSON configuration file located at `public/portfolioConfig.json`. This approach allows for easy content updates without touching the codebase. The configuration includes:

- Personal information (name, title, location, intro, etc.)
- Experience history (positions, companies, descriptions)
- Skills (categorized technical skills)
- Projects (descriptions, technologies, links)
- Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email, etc.)
- SEO metadata (title, description, keywords)

To modify the content:
1. Edit the `public/portfolioConfig.json` file
2. The changes will be automatically reflected in the website
3. No code changes required for content updates

You can also customize the location of the configuration file by setting the `CONFIG_URL` environment variable during build:

```bash
# Use a custom configuration file URL
CONFIG_URL=https://example.com/my-config.json npm run build
```

If not specified, it will use the default `/portfolioConfig.json` path.

Example configuration structure:
```json
{
  "personalInfo": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "title": "Your Title",
    "location": "Your Location",
    "intro": "Your introduction",
    "jobStatus": "Current job status",
    "resumeUrl": "URL to your resume",
    "calendarUrl": "URL to your calendar"
  },
  "socialLinks": [
    {
      "name": "GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/yourusername",
      "icon": "github"
    }
  ]
  // ... other sections
}
```

### Styling

- Global styles are defined in `src/styles/global.scss`
- Variables (colors, spacing, etc.) are defined in `src/styles/variables.scss`
- Each component has its own SCSS file for component-specific styling

### Resume

Replace the placeholder file at `public/sonam_kumari_resume.pdf` with your actual resume.

## Building for Production
